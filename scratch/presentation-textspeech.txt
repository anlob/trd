Hello,

my name is Andreas.

No, this ist not Bill Gates
and this is not a garage.
But in fact I would say,
that there might be some similarities.
===

I want to talk about handling of cryptocurrencies,
that is trading and usage for end users.
The volatility of cryptocurrencies makes usage
and trading difficult.

- Short-term price changes can not or rarely
be addressed, as an individual can not respond
adequately to them at any time.

- The vast majority of traders try to make profits
by coffee grounds reading technique.
They bet on rising prices or sell hastily
if the price threatens to topple.
This amplifies trends the longer they are lasting.
=== (pointing on "chart" pic)
Every little rumor is taken as an opportunity,
to derive a price trend from it.

The consequences are a highly volatile portfolio,
sleepless nights and, in most cases, profit losses.
Me, as a typical end user does not want to spend
a signigicant part of his life in front of the monitor
studying charts. I simply want to secure my earned
fiat money by exchanging it to a currency,
which cannot be devaluated by inflation. And of course
I want to make some profit in the long term, as I expect
raising acceptance and usage respectively, which
automatically should lead to an increase in value,
when more an more goods and services need to be mapped
to a finite amount of cryptocurrency.
And most important:
I do not want to go to bed as a millionaire and stand up
as a beggar, as the next crash has happened
during the night.

I see a market gap here. End users need support
by professional software, which handles this volatility
without need of Interaction.

The result of this I call it "Balance" Trading Logic.
=== (switching to "water column" pic)
Some advantages of it:
- Foolproof
- Implementation does not need much bandwidth
- Does trade acyclic, similar to the rule:
  "Buy when there's blood in the streets".

How does it function:

The basic idea is to share gains and losses
across all assets in your portfolio.
Within this picture the capitalization of each
asset is represented as a water column.
All water columns are interconnected, so the
water levels in all water coulumns are almost
the same. Each interconnection is controlled
by a valve, which opens up from a certain
pressure difference. So the water level difference
in two water columns is never greater then
the resulting pressure difference, to open
related valve and equalize both levels.
And this is exactly the only one rule defining
this model: The capitalizations of all assets
are in balance, they are almost the same,
at any time.

What does that mean in consequence?

Let's say the price for a particular currency
is rising. This would result to an increase
of the water level in related water column.
But as the water column is interconnected
with all others, the water level in all
water columns raises, which is in real
performed by selling some of that currency,
whose price is currently increasing and the
sales proceeds is spread amongst all other
assets by purchasing.

Similar, when the price of a currency is falling,
other assets get sold and the sales proceeds
is used to purchase more of that curreny,
whose price is currently falling.
Figuratively speaking, the water flows from all
the other water columns into that water column,
which is currently leaking
